                                    Policy and practice on peacebuilding is most effective when it is rooted in a clear understanding of research and evidence.
                                    The Genocide Research Hub aims to contribute to building a knowledge society around genocide prevention and peacebuilding
                                    policy and practice in Rwanda. This hub was established in 2018 as a global knowledge exchange platform for researchers,
                                    policymakers, and practitioners, and is primarily focused on the Rwandan situation, placed in regional and global context.

                                    Aegis Trust is an international organisation that originated in the UK in 2000. Its mission is to work towards the prediction, 
                                    prevention and ultimately the elimination of genocide for the benefit of humanity, primarily through research, education and 
                                    the dissemination of information and advice. In 2002, Aegis Trust was invited to work with Rwandan authorities to establish 
                                    the Kigali Genocide Memorial which opened in 2004. Rwanda has remained the largest country involvement for Aegis Trust up 
                                    to the present, although Aegis plans to bring the lessons and inspiration of Rwandan peacebuilding experiences to other 
                                    countries in east and central Africa as part of its regional strategy. Click here to learn more on Aegis Trust.
